# Marcin Banking

My banking system in Java. 3.0 it's the final and last version. 

✓✓✓ Creating account system. It is saving profile in extrernal .txt file in src/ folder.

✓✓✓ Login system, checking if customer have an account in the system. 

✓✓✓ Password request, if you will put 3 times wrong password, you will get 5 minutes of timeout.

✓✓✓ Withdraws and deposit, all data will be stored in external file.

✓✓✓ Tranfers between accounts. Ofcourse it also storing all changes.

Thanks for a feedback. :)
